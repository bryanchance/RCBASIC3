To build an apk for android follow these steps.

Prior to building for android you will need the to install the following:
*Java ( On Linux it needs to be OpenJDK 8)
*Ant ( Only if on Linux. It should be bundled in this package if you are on Windows.)


CHANGING ICON
------------------------------------------
Go in the rcbasic_android/res folder. Inside the folders below replace ic_launcher.png with a png that is the following sizes listed by folder.

drawable-hdpi - 72 x 72
drawable-mdpi - 48 x 48
drawable-xhdpi - 96 x 96
drawable-hdpi - 144 x 144



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------------
1. Rename your compiled *.cbc file to main.cbc and put it in the RCBASIC_PROJECT_DIR folder along with all the assets for your program (ie. music, graphics, etc.)

2. Open the build.properties file and set the path for your java installation (You can disregard this step on linux). On the last line set the API version you want to use.

Here is an explanation of the Java path on Windows.

	JAVA_HOME = path where javac.exe is installed

3. Run the build_android program to go through the build process.  If you don't already have a release key read the instructions under the PUBLISHING section below for steps on how to make one.

4. Your apk will appear in the APK folder. You can put it on your phone or tablet to install it.


PUBLISHING
----------------------------------
To be able to publish your app on Google Play you will need to build a release build. To do that you will need to make a keystore. If you don't already have one you can run the gen_key program to go through the process of making one.


If you have any problems with any of the instructions written here, feel free to ask for help at rcbasic.freeforums.net.
