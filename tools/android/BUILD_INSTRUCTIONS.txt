To build an apk for android follow these steps.

Prior to building for android you will need the to install the following:
*Java ( On Linux it needs to be OpenJDK 8)
*Ant

SETUP
------------------------------
API_VERSION = the specific API you want to target. You must install this through android sdk manager before you can target it. Just go inside the tools_r25.2.5 folder, open a terminal/DOS Window, and type the command android.

Once the Window comes up, you will need to select the SDK tools and Platform tools for the version of Android you want to target.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------------
1. Rename your compiled *.cbc file to main.cbc and put it in the RCBASIC_PROJECT_DIR folder along with all the assets for your program (ie. music, graphics, etc.)

2. Open the build.properties file and set the path for your java installation (You can disregard this step on linux). On the last line set the API version you want to use.

3. In the rcbasic_android folder, open AndroidManifest.xml. Inside that file look for this line:

	<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="22" android:targetSdkVersion="22" />

Change the SDK Version to the version number of the API you want to use.


Here is an explanation of the Java path on Windows.

	JAVA_HOME = path where javac.exe is installed

3. Run the build_android program to go through the build process.  If you don't already have a release key read the instructions under the PUBLISHING section below for steps on how to make one.

4. Your apk will appear in the APK folder. You can put it on your phone or tablet to install it.


PUBLISHING
----------------------------------
To be able to publish your app on Google Play you will need to build a release build. To do that you will need to make a keystore. If you don't already have one you can run the gen_key program to go through the process of making one.


CHANGING APP ICONS, SCREEN ORIENTATION, ETC.
-------------------------------------------------
To change your icons you will need to go into the rcbasic_android/res folder. There is multiple folders for multiple resolution displays. You will need to have an appropriately scaled icon for each one.

To change other attributes in your app such as screen orientation and permissions, you will need to edit the AndroidManifest.xml with your appropriate changes.
