RCBasic Programming Language


RCBasic is a free and open source dialect of the BASIC programming language.  It is intended to
be a simple and powerful language for developing games and multimedia software.  As this is
open source software, anyone is welcome to contribute ideas, documentation, and code to help
improve it.
