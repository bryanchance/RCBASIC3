<b><u>1: GRAPHICS</u></b><br>
RCBasic has a powerful 2D graphics API. To be able to draw graphics you first need a window. You can have up to 8 windows in desktop
applications and only a single window in a mobile app. Once a window is opened, all drawing is done on virtual render targets called
canvases. Each window can have up to 8 canvases, which are numbered 0 to 7. When defining a canvas, you will need to consider the size
of the canvas and the size of its viewport. The canvas size specifies the total area available to draw on and the viewport specifies the total area that will be displayed.
<br><br><img src="images\window_gfx_structure.png"><br>
The image shown above outlines the structure of a graphics program consisting of one 640x480 window which has a 220x200 canvas in it.
The viewport of this canvas is 120x100 which means only a 120x100 section of the total canvas will be shown. Below is the code to create
this window.
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"GFX Exampe"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<span class="keyword">CanvasOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">220</span>, <span class="number">200</span>, <span class="number">60</span>, <span class="number">90</span>, <span class="number">120</span>, <span class="number">100</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
</span></p>
<br>
There is quite a bit that is being done in the 2 lines of code above.
<br>
<br><b><u>WindowOpen(0, "GFX Exampe", 0, 0, 640, 480, 0)</u></b>
<br><b>0</b> - The number of the window. Windows can be numbered from 0 to 7. (Only window 0 is accessible on mobile)
<br><b>"GFX Example"</b> - The title of the window
<br><b>0, 0</b> - The x and y position of the window (you can use the constant WINDOWPOS_CENTERED to open the window in the middle of the desktop)
<br><b>640, 480</b> - The width and height of the window
<br><b>0</b> - This flag can be 0 for windowed and 1 for fullscreen
<br>
<br><b><u>CanvasOpen(0, 220, 200, 60, 90, 120, 100, 0)</u></b>
<br><b>0</b> - The number of the canvas. Canvases can be numbered from 0 to 7.
<br><b>220, 200</b> - The total area available for drawing
<br><b>60, 90</b> - Where in the window the canvas will be displayed. (This point will be where the (x,y) will be 0 when drawing on this canvas)
<br><b>120, 100</b> - The width and height of the viewport. This is the size of the canvas area that will be displayed.
<br><b>0</b> - This flag can be 0 for solid and 1 for transparent.
<br><br>
Once a canvas is opened you can begin drawing to the canvas. Once you are done drawing you have to call the Update() function to
display everything you have drawn. Even if you are not drawing anything you should call Update() atleast once in your main loop
to update the event queue otherwise you will not be able to get mouse/keyboard/joystick events, window events, touch events, etc.
So a simple program that draws a red rectangle on the screen would look like this:
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"GFX Exampe"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<span class="keyword">CanvasOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">220</span>, <span class="number">200</span>, <span class="number">60</span>, <span class="number">90</span>, <span class="number">120</span>, <span class="number">100</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">SetColor</span>(<span class="keyword">RGB</span>(<span class="number">255</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">0</span>))   <i>Set the Drawing color to RED</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">RectFill</span>(<span class="number">20</span>, <span class="number">20</span>, <span class="number">100</span>, <span class="number">100</span>)   <i>Draw a 100x100 rectangle at position (20, 20) on the canvas</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">Update</span>()   <i>'Show all the drawing we have done and update the event queue</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">WaitKey</span>()   <i>'This will make our program wait until a key is pressed before ending</i><br>
</span></p>
<br>
As previously mentioned, you have access to up to 8 canvases. If you have more than one canvas you can use the Canvas() function to
switch which canvas you are drawing to. Here is an example of drawing a rectangle to 2 different canvases.
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"GFX Exampe"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<span class="keyword">CanvasOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">220</span>, <span class="number">200</span>, <span class="number">60</span>, <span class="number">90</span>, <span class="number">120</span>, <span class="number">100</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>

<br>
<span class="keyword">Update</span>()   <i>'Show all the drawing we have done and update the event queue</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">WaitKey</span>()   <i>'This will make our program wait until a key is pressed before ending</i><br>
</span></p>
<br>
Along with being able to draw shapes, RCBasic has several built-in commands for loading and drawing images. You can load a total of
4096 images that can be loaded at one time which are numbered from 0 to 4095. The following will load an image and draw it.
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"GFX Exampe"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<span class="keyword">CanvasOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">220</span>, <span class="number">200</span>, <span class="number">60</span>, <span class="number">90</span>, <span class="number">120</span>, <span class="number">100</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">LoadImage</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"tst_image.png"</span>)   <i>'loads an image file called tst_image.png into image slot 0</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">DrawImage</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">20</span>, <span class="number">20</span>)   <i>'draws the image in slot 0 at position (20, 20) on the canvas</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">Update</span>()   <i>'Show all the drawing we have done and update the event queue</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">WaitKey</span>()   <i>'This will make our program wait until a key is pressed before ending</i><br>
</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>2: SOUND</u></b><br>
Loading and playing sounds is similiar to how you would load and draw images. There are a total 1024 sounds that can be loaded at
one time. Here is a simple program that loads and plays a single sound.
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"Sound Exampe"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">LoadSound</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"MySound.wav"</span>)   <i>'Load a sound file into sound slot 0</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">PlaySound</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">3</span>)   <i>'Play the sound loaded in slot 0 on channel 1 for 3 loops</i><br>
<br>
<span class="keyword">Update</span>()<br>
<span class="keyword">waitkey</span>()<br>
</span></p>
<br>
There is only 1 music track that can be loaded at one time. Loading and playing music is pretty straight forward.
<p><span class="code"><br>
<span class="keyword">WindowOpen</span>(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="string">"Sound Example"</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">640</span>, <span class="number">480</span>, <span class="number">0</span>)<br>
<span class="keyword">LoadMusic</span> ( <span class="string">"MYMUSIC.MP3"</span> )<br>
<span class="keyword">PlayMusic</span> ( -<span class="number">1</span> )   <i>'Setting the music loop to -1 will have it loop infinitely</i><br>
<span class="keyword">Update</span>()<br>
<span class="keyword">waitkey</span>()<br>
</span></p>
<br>
