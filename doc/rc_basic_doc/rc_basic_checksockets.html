    <title>RC BASIC CHECKSOCKETS</title>
  </head>
  <body><b>CheckSockets ( timeout_ms )</b><br>
    <br>
    Checks all connected sockets for activity. If timeout_ms is greater than 0 than it will wait that many milliseconds. If less than 0 <br>
    it will wait for over 49 days (hint: there is no reason what so ever to set this less than 0). <br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span  style="font-style: italic;"><span class="keyword">CheckSockets</span> ( <span class="number">0</span> )<br>
	<br>
	This will return the number of sockets that have activity (ie. a connection was made or data was sent)
