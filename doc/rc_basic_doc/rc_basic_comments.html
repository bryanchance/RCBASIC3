      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments are remarks you can add to your code which will be ignored by the compiler.&nbsp; To make a comment you would use a single
    quote.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="code">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">' THIS IS A COMMENT</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="keyword">Print</span> <span class="string">HELLO WORLD"</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">' THIS
    IS ANOTHER COMMENT</span><br>
    <br>
    </span>
    
    <strong><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">MULTI-LINE COMMENTS<br>
      </span></strong> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-line comments are comments that can span multiple lines.&nbsp; To start a multi-line comment you would use forward slash followed
      by a single quote and you would end it with a single quote followed by a forward slash.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="code">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">/' THIS IS </span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment"> A </span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment">MULTI-LINE COMMENT '/</span><br>
    <br>
    </span>
  </body>
