RCBasic comes with 2 command-line tools for creating programs. The first is rcbasic_build which takes your
sourcecode in your *.bas file and compiles it into a *.cbc.  The *.cbc file contains intermediate bytecode
which can be ran with the rcbasic (rcbasic.exe on windows) application. To distribute your program you will
need to package your *.cbc file with a copy of the rcbasic executable which needs to be renamed to the name of
your *.cbc file.

For Example:
If you have myprogram.cbc then rcbasic needs to be renamed to myprogram (myprogram.exe on windows).
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b>On Windows, you need to include all the 32-bit dlls with the 32-bit executable and all the 64-bit
dlls with the 64-bit executable. The rcbasic package tool will automatically do all of this for you as well as package for
other systems as well.

<br><br>
<b><u>RUN PROGRAMS FROM GEANY</u></b>
<br><br><u>LINUX</u><br>
In the installer directory there is a folder called geany_files. Inside the folder there is a file named
filetypes.rcbasic. You can override the geany *.bas configuration by replacing the freeBasic configuration
with this file. Just copy this file to the geany filedefs path, which on most linux distibutions should be
(/home/.config/geany/filedefs), and rename the file to filetypes.freebasic.
<br><br>
Once you have rcbasic set up with geany you just need to create a new file and save it as *.bas. Then you can
compile your program by going to Build->Compile. Once your program is compiled you can run it by going to
Build->Execute.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you want to use a different file extension for rcbasic programs you can still use this file and just set
it up for a different extension. Refer to the geany documentation on how to set up different file types.

<br><br><br><u>WINDOWS</u><br>
Geany comes preconfigured with rcbasic on windows. Just run the start_editor.bat file and create a new *.bas
file. Select the File->New with Template option in the menu to start with a simple template program. Once you
have created a new *.bas file goto Build->Compile to compile your program to a *.cbc file. Then goto Build->Execute
to run your program.


<br><br><br>
<b><u>USING RCBASIC FROM THE COMMAND-LINE</u></b><br>
RCBasic will be added to path on install on linux. On Windows you will need to add the rcbasic folder to your path.
Either (rcbasic/rcbasic_32) or (rcbasic/rcbasic_64) depending on your operating system.

Once rcbasic is in your path you can simple pass a source file to rcbasic_build to create a *.cbc file.
<p><span class="code"><br>
rcbasic_build myprogram.bas<br>
</span></p>
<br>
Once you have a *.cbc file you can pass it to rcbasic to run it.
<p><span class="code"><br>
rcbasic myprogram.cbc<br>
</span></p>
<br>
Both tools also except the -v argument which will simply output the version of rcbasic you are using.
<p><span class="code"><br>
rcbasic_build -v<br>
rcbasic -v<br>
</span></p>
